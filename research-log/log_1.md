Thesis Weekly Log
================

### Week 1: 17 February - 23 February

#### Overview:

This week was about initial research and establishing a timeline for
projects.

#### Research

I have gathered four textbooks: *Sampling* by Steven K. Thompson,
*Design and Inference in Finite Population Sampling* by A.S. Hedayat and
Bikas K. Sinha, *Adaptive Sampling* by Steven K. Thompson and George
A.F. Seber, and *Sampling Techniques* by William G. Cochran. My goal was
to gain an overview of sampling as a whole, and then take a deep look
into non-probability sampling.

#### Looking Forward

With the next few weeks, I want to have completed a literature review on
non-probability sampling. I need to set up an appointment with Robin
Ford so that I can establish a relationship with them, and gain some
insight on the best way to acquire literature in the sciences.
