### Week 1: 17 February - 23 February

#### Overview:
  as this is week 1, I did not accomplish much in the terms of research. I spent time gathering resources and setting up this github repository. I've done some intial reading of the resources.

#### Research
 I have gathered textbooks on sampling, surveys, and polls.
  

#### Looking Forward
  With the next few weeks, I want to have completed a literature review on non-probability sampling. I need to set up an appointment with Robin Ford so that I can establish a relationship with them, and gain some insight on the best way to acquire literature in the sciences.
