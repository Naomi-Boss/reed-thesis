Data Exploration:

Variables:
i: specific poll
n_i: number of respondents in poll i who prefer D or R
v_{r[i]}: final two party vote share for R
r[i]: election corresponding to the poll i
\overline{y}_i: average poll estimate for election r
S_r: set of polls for election r
y_i: two-party support for R in poll i

RMSE:
i: specific poll
y_i: two party support for republican candidate
N: number of polls
r[i]: election corresponding to poll i
\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - v_{r[i]})^2}



Estimate Total Survey Error by computing the difference between
  (1) support for R candidate in poll
  (2) final vote share for that candidate on election day
  
*two-party poll and vote share*

Figure: Distribution of differences
  positive values: more support in poll than in election

*polling errors centered at 0
*polls exhibit substationally larger errors than one would expect from SRS

Figure: poll error measured by RMSE (of a 7 day window) against time

Avg poll estimate:
\overline{y}_r = \frac{1}{|S_r|}\sum_{i\in S_r}y_i




Simulate polling result by drawing sample from Binomial
~Binom(v_r, n_i/2) -> halving the size of the poll doubles variance -> increases dispersion of poll averages



Model for Election Polls:
Their Result:
  Bias: systematic errors shared by all polls in a specific election
  Variance: residual dispersion for various reasons

Bayesian meta-analysis of survey results
*****

Let y_i denote the two-party support for R (poll) for poll i in election r[i] at time t[i] with n_i respondents who prefer D or R

v_{r[i]} denote final two party share



model poll outcome:
y_i ~ N(p_i, \sigma^2_i)
logit(p_i) = logit(v_r[i]) + \alpha_{r[i]} + \beta_{r[i]}t_i
\sigma^2-i+
